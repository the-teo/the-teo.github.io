                        <p id="jessica-jones-paragraph">Jessica Campbell Jones Cage is a fictional superhero appearing
                            in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer
                            Brian Michael Bendis and artist Michael Gaydos and first appeared in Alias #1 (November
                            2001), as part of Marvel's Max, an imprint for more mature content. Within the context of
                            Marvel's shared universe, Jones is a former superhero who becomes the owner (and usually
                            sole employee) of Alias Private Investigations. Bendis originally envisioned the series
                            centered on Jessica Drew and only decided to create Jones once he noticed that the main
                            character had a distinct voice and background that differentiated her from Drew.</p>
                        <p id="jessica-jones-paragraph">Jones has since starred in three ongoing series: Alias, The
                            Pulse and Jessica Jones. Alias ran for 28 issues before ending in 2004, while The Pulse ran
                            for 14 issues from April 2004 to May 2006. Jessica Jones debuted in October 2016. She became
                            a member of the New Avengers, alongside her husband, Luke Cage, during Marvel's 2010 Heroic
                            Age campaign. She has used various aliases throughout her history, including Jewel,
                            Knightress and Power Woman.</p>
